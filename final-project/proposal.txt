CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
WordPress to Jekyll Database Migrator

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
Blogging platforms often need to migrate content from WordPress to Jekyll (a static site generator). This tool automates the conversion of WordPress exported posts into properly formatted Jekyll Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, saving time and reducing manual work for content migration.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
File I/O operations, CSV parsing and data extraction, string manipulation and Unicode normalization, regular expressions for pattern matching and slug generation, date/time handling and formatting, YAML frontmatter structure, and automation of data transformation tasks.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    os, csv, datetime, re, unicodedata, shutil

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. List the names of functions you will need?

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

    sanitize_slug() - Takes a string title and returns a URL-safe slug
    read_csv_file() - Reads WordPress export CSV and returns filtered posts by category
    process_post_row() - Processes a single post row and returns formatted post data
    generate_frontmatter() - Takes post metadata and returns Jekyll YAML frontmatter string
    add_dropcaps() - Adds HTML dropcaps to the first letter of content
    format_markdown_file() - Combines frontmatter and content into complete Markdown format
    write_markdown_file() - Takes filename and content, writes to disk

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
    test_sanitize_slug_basic() - Test basic slug generation from titles
    test_sanitize_slug_special_chars() - Test handling of special characters
    test_sanitize_slug_unicode() - Test Unicode and accented character handling
    test_sanitize_slug_spaces() - Test space-to-hyphen conversion
    test_add_dropcaps_basic() - Test dropcaps added to first letter
    test_add_dropcaps_empty() - Test dropcaps with empty content
    test_generate_frontmatter_format() - Test correct YAML frontmatter format
    test_format_markdown_file_structure() - Test complete Markdown file structure with frontmatter and content
